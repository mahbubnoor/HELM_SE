# Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine for Speech Enhancement

The following GitHub repository contains the implementation of the extreme learning machine (ELM)- and hierarchical ELM (HELM)-based speech enhancement frameworks using MATLAB and python. In these experiments, ELM and HELM are used as a regression model to perform speech enhancement. The main concept is to use an ELM/HELM model to transform noisy speech to clean speech. The overall structure of the HELM model is illustrated in Fig. 1. 

The overall system includes offline and online stages
